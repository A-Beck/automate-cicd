= CI example =

This is a generic example of a CI setup as it was used in a consulting engagement.

== Getting started ==

Follow the instructions in https://github.com/redhat-cop/automate-cicd/blob/ericzolf-create-callback-job/hackathons/rhte-2018-emea/README.adoc[this README] and log in to bastion: `sudo ssh bastion.GUID.rhte.opentlc.com`.

== Jenkins setup ==

1. `cd automate-cicd/hackathons/rhte-2018-emea/callback-plugin-ci`
1. Replace `GUID` and `PASSWORD` and run `sudo ansible-playbook -i cicd1.GUID.internal setup_jenkins_job.yml -e 'usual_password=PASSWORD' -e 'guid=GUID'` to set up a Jenkins Project.
1. Open https://cicd1.GUID.rhte.opentlc.com:8443 in a browser and login as _admin_ (usual password)

== Triggering builds ==

To run your test-playbooks, open the project in Jenkins' WebGUI (https://cicd1.GUID.rhte.opentlc.com:8443/job/callback-plugin-ci/) and click on _Build with Parameters_. 
You can then select a directory and a pattern to chose which tests are ran. Keep all on default to trigger everything in `test_matrix`.

== Developing Tests ==

You can now write your own tests.
Go to `automate-cicd/hackathons/rhte-2018-emea/callback-plugin-ci/test_jenkins/test_matrix` and add test playbooks.
The pattern defined in the previous section is applied to the file name of the playbooks, so use a name that fits `test*.yml` to stay with the default example.
Before the testes are available from within Jenkins, you need to re-run the playbook from the _Jenkins setup_ section above.

== Junit plugin ==

Some background information: In this environment, Ansible is configured to use the junit https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/plugins/callback.html[callback plugin].
The job output is written to `ansible_junit_logs/` and then picked up by Jenkins. You can see the corresponding settings in https://cicd1.GUID.rhte.opentlc.com:8443/job/callback-plugin-ci/configure under _Post-build Actions_.

== Including SCM ==

Now that the basics are establisehd, you probably wonder "_What's next?_".
One possibility â€“ albeit not a very is to go to http://cicd1.GUID.rhte.opentlc.com:3000, log in as user _cicduser1_ and create a repository named REPONAME (chose anything).
You can initialise it any way you want.

Now we can for example create a mock test of the current state of the repo by adding a file called `to_be_tested.txt` containing a zero.
The following playbook can be used to test this addition (create it, e.g., as `test_matrix/test_repo.yml`)

----
---
- name: test if our repo is ok
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - assert:
        that:
          -  "{{ lookup( 'file', '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/callback-plugin-ci/git/REPONAME/to_be_tested.txt') }} ==  0"
----

Don't forget to run the playbook `setup_jenkins_job.yml` after having updated the test.

Now, you could for example add the following as a _Execute shell_ build step (in the _Build_ section of your Project's config) before the step executing `call_all_test_playbooks.sh`:

----
cd git/
if [ ! -d REPONAME ]
then
  git clone http://localhost:3000/cicduser1/REPONAME.git
fi
cd test
git pull
----

If you save and then run a build (default parameters) you should see a successful result.
Changing the content of `to_be_tested.txt` in Gogs and then runing a build leads to a failure.

*Note* that this is not a recomended way of polling a git repo (ideally, you would want to use Jenkins' SCM integration); it should be good enough for this demo, though.
*Note2:* `setup_jenkins_job.yml` overwrites these manual changes to the Project config.
